CSE 502N Data Structures and Algorithms

Study of fundamental algorithms, data structures, and their effective use in a variety of applications. 

Emphasizes importance of data structure choice and implementation for obtaining the most efficient algorithm for solving a given problem. 

A key component of this course is worst-case asymptotic analysis, which provides a quick and simple method for determining the scalability and effectiveness of an algorithm.
