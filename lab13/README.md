# cse247-s20-graders
Baseline repo for CSE 247/502N graders for Spring 2020.

Template repo (no lab writeups, may or may not have lab solns): cse247-s20-tas-labs-teamgrader-template
Template repo should contain skeleton code for the
semester.

To create grader repo from template repo code:
1. Create classroom for graders in GHC if not already done. Associate
   the classroom with the appropriate organization, e.g. cse247s20.
2. Upload roster of graders/OH TAs to this GHC classroom.
3. Create assignment in GHC for this repo (link to assignment
   will be shared with graders).
   - Make the assignment a group assignment.
   - Limit the number of teams to 1 and the number of participants
     per team to a ceiling on the total number of graders.
   - Use the template repo 
     (e.g. cse247-s20-tas-labs-teamgrader-template) as the template 
     for the assignment.
   - Use desired prefix for assignment repo, 
     e.g. cse247-s20-tas-labs .
4. An assignment link will be generated and displayed in GHC. Open
   the link.
5. Create a new team, e.g. "TeamGrader" .  This single team will be the 
   only one graders can join because we limited the number of teams for
   the assignment to 1.  The team will be visible on GH.
6. The repo will be created in GH, e.g. cse247-tas-labs-teamgrader .
7. Go to the organization that owns the GHC (e.g. cse247s20), go to
   Teams, select the team you created ("TeamGrader"), go to Repositories.
   Change the access permissions on the repo from "Write" to "Read" ,
   which will give graders read-only access to the repo.
8. Share the GHC link for the new assignment with graders.  When they 
   click the link, they'll have to join the "TeamGrader" team and then 
   they should have access to the repo as desired.
9. Push files to the repo throughout the semester and graders can
   pull the latest copy to their local machines or view it on GH to
   see them.
  - Push only final version of files graders need to see (e.g. .pdf) rather than source (e.g. .tex).
10. Enjoy!
